  📄 **_Self-Reported Concussion History: Impact of Providing a Definition of Concussion_**  
  **Authors:** Robbins CA; Daneshvar DH; Picano JD; Gavett BE; Baugh CM; Riley DO; Nowinski CJ; McKee AC; Cantu RC; Stern RA  
  **Link:** [DOI](https://doi.org/10.2147/OAJSM.S58005)  
  **Type:** Peer-reviewed journal article  
  **Summary:** In a cross-sectional study of 472 current and former athletes, participants were asked to report their lifetime number of concussions before and after being read a currently accepted medical definition of concussion. The median self-reported number nearly doubled after they heard the definition.  
  **Takeaway:** Athletes’ understanding of what "concussion" means can significantly affect how many they report. Providing clear definitions improves accuracy of self-reported concussion history.  
  **Relevance to Project:** Demonstrates that if *Collision Course* aims to educate users on the experience of a concussion, it should always present a clear, current medical definition before disccusion of the topic in order to maintain medical integrity and educational consistency.
